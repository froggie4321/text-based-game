THis will contain notes on things that need to be added or fixed next time.

1) okay so i need to add getters and setters for attributes, items, equipment,and stats classes
2) Add constructors and destructors to all classes listed on line 1
3) use those setters and getters to update stats on the character class.
3) once all that is done try  make game and see if everything compiles and runs fine.
